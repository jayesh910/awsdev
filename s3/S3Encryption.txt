2 tYPES of encryption

In Transit: There is encryption when you are uploading file from machine to bucket & vice versa.
  That is done using SSL/TSL . TSL is getting replaced with SSL. i.e. using HTTPS.
  
At Rest
  Server side encryption:
    -S3 managed keys - SSE-S3  . This is done with 256 bit encryption.
    -AWS Key management service, Managed keys, SSE-KMS
    -Server Side encryption with Customer provided keys - SSE-C

Client Side Encryption
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Enforcing Encryption on S3 bucket:
    -Every time a file is uploaded to S3, a put request is initiated
    -example: PUT /myFile HTTP1.1 ........ Expect: 100-continue
    Expect is for confirmation that acknowledge has been received , if not the request is cancelled.
    
If file has to be encrypted while uploading: use x-amz-server-side-encryption parameter in the request header.

Two option for x-amz
1. x-amz-server-side-encryption: AES256(SSE-S3)
2. x-amz-server-side-encryption: ams:kms(SSE-KMS)

If this is not added to header, it denies the request.
     -example: PUT /myFile HTTP1.1 ........ Expect: 100-continue x-amz-server-side-encryption: AES256
