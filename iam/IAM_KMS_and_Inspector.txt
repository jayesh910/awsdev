KMS : Key Management service:
Create and control the encryption keys used to encrypt.

CONCEPTS: 

* Customer Master Keys (CMKs):
	- CMKs are used to encrypt/decrypt up to 4kb of data and are the primary resource in KMS.
	- CMKs generate, e/d data keys that you use outside of AWS KMS to encrypt data.
	- 2 types of CMKs:
		i. Customer-Managed: CMKs you create and manage policies to access it.
		ii. AWS-managed: Created and managed by AWS (e.g. aws/service-name . aws/s3).

* Data Keys:
	- Encryption keys for encrypting large amnts of data or other data encryption keys.
	- AWS CMKs genreate, encrypt and decrypt data keys.
	- KMS does not manage or store data keys,
* Envelope Encryption:
	- Plaintext data is encrypted with Data key.
	- Data keys are encrypted with a key encryption key (KEK)
	- KEK may be encrypted by another KEK, but there is Master key (KMS CMK) that decrypts one or more keys.

AWS Inspector: 
===============
- inspector is not part of IAM but its part of security.
- automated security assessment service that helps improve the security and compliance of applications
- automatically assesses applications for exposure, vulnerabilities, and deviations from best practices
- Inspector produces a detailed list of security findings prioritized by level of severity
