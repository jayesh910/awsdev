Components of IAM: Users, roles, policies, Groups and API keys

Create MFA . 
Create separate user and do not use root user. Create Group for each specifications.
Setup Password Policy for IAM users.

POLICY:
=======
Policy is a document that states one or more permission.

2 kinds of permissions policies : Explicit Allow(Admin access)
				  Explicit Deny(Denyy all policy.)
Explicit deny will always overrides Allow.(i.e User will have no access to any resource)

Read-only access: Limited to the list action only. 
We can have custom policy. 
More than one policy can be attached to user at a time
Policies cannot be attached directly to Resources.

USER:
=====
user ARN: arn:aws:iam:<accnt number>:user/<Name of user>
Do not share keys and credentials with anyone.
User creds should not be stored on EC2 instance.  
Attach policy directly to the user.


GROUPS:
=======
We can create group of developers and add users to it.
We can attach policies to groups such that all users will get that policy attached.
You can copy policy from one user to other.

ROLES:
======
Role is necessay part for AWS resources inside and outside the AWS.
Roles msut be used becoz resources cannot be attached with policies.
You can now change/replace the role to EC2 instance when created or running.
Createe cross account role between two aws user account. 
Attach permission policy while creating role.
While creating EC2 instance , attach IAM role to that instance.
