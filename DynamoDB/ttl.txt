DynamoDB TTL:

- Time to live
- defines an expired time for data
- expired items marked for deletion
- great for removing irrelevant or old data
  - session data
  - event log
  - Temporary data
- Reduces cost by automatically removing data which is no longer relevant

Create a table with expiration time as column
Select TTL in dynamoDB & insert the attribute/column name in which time is mentioned 
In our case we use epoch time 
Since time is mentioned , at that time the data will get deleted.
