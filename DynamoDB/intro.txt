DynamoDB is fast & flexible NoSQL Database service for all applications 
That need consistent, single digit millisecond latency at any scale
Fully managed database
supports both document & key-value data models.
fit for mobile ,web ,gaming , ad-tech, IoT & many other applications.
Goes best with Lambda


- stored on SSD
- Spread across 3 geographical distinct data centers
- Choice of 2 consistency data models:
  - Eventual consistent reads(default)[Best read performance]
  - Strongly consistent reads[returns a result that reflects all writes that received a successful response prior to the read]
  
Consist of :
  Tables
  Items -rows
  Attribute - column
  Support key-value & document data structures
  Document in form of JSON, HTML or XML
  
  
DynamoDB stores & retrieve data according to primary keys.
2 types of Primary key
1. Partition key: Unique attribute like userid  . Value of partition key is input to an internal hash function 
which determines where is physical location on which data is stored.
No two items can have same partition key.

2. Composite Key: (Partition key + Sort Key)
example : partition key = user id & sort key = timestamp of the post
Two items can have same partition key but they must have differnt sort key.
All items with same partition key are stored together then sorted according to the sort key value.

IAM conditions: You can restrict the data to limited people only.
For e.g. if you want to view your data but want to restrict not to see other's data , you can manage that by using IAM policy, where you will only see your data and not other users data by matching primary key value with user id.
