Data structure which allows to perform fast queries on specific columns in a table.
Select the column that you want to include in index
2 types of indexes:
  - Local secondary indexes
  - Global secondary indexes
 
Local secondary key:
 - Can only be created when you are creating the table.
 - cannot add, remove or modify after table creation
 - Same partition key as your original table
 - but a different sort key
 - Any queries based on this sort key are much faster using the index than the main table.
 e.g. Partition key: User ID
      Sort key: Account creation data
      
 Global secondary key:
  - Create when you create your table, or add it later
  - Different partition key as well as a different sort key
  - gives a completely different view of the data
  - speeds up any queries relating to this alternative partition & sort key.
  - e.g. Partition key: email address 
         Sort key: last log-in date
