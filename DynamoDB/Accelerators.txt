DAX: In-memory cache for DynamoDB

10X Read performance
Microsecond performance for millions of requests/sec
Ideal for read heavy & busty workloads
e.g. Auction, gaming, retail sites, etc

It is also Write- through caching service , means
data will be copied to DAX cluster & dynamoDB at the same time
If item you are quering is in the DAX cluster it will give it, if not
it will first copy the data from DynamoDB & then provide it to the end.
This is known as Eventually consistent GetItem operation

Reduces the load on DynamoDB tables
May Reduce provisioned read capacity
But will not save the money on DynamoDB


Not suitable for:
  - Strongly consistent reads
  - App that do not perform many read operation
  - App that do not require msecs response time
