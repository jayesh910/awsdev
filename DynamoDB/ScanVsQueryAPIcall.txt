Query: finds items in table based on primary key attribute & value to search for
e.g select an item where the user ID is equal to 212, will select all the attributes for that item

use an optional sort key if multiple partition are same.
e.g. if sort key is timestamp, refine the query to only select items with a timestamp of last 7 days.

Use projectionExpression parameter if you want the query to only return specific attributes you want.
e.g. only return email addresses rather than all attributes.

Results are sorted by sort keys
Numeric order & by ASCII characters order
Reverse the order by setting ScanIndexForward parameter to false.
Queries are by default Eventually consistent 
Need to explicitly set the query to be Strongly consistent


SCAN
  - Scan operation examines every item in the table.
  - By default returns all data attributes
  - Use ProjectionExpression parameter to refine the scan to only return attributes you want.
  - IN SCAN YOU CAN USE FILTER WHICH WILL PROVIDE ALL TYPE OF OPTIONS e.g. attribute, operation.
  
Query works better than Scan.
Improving Scan performance:
  - Scan opreation processes data sequentially returning 1MB increments & then moves to next 1MB increments of data .
  - It can scan upto 1 partition at a time.
  - To scan multiple partition , you can divide partition into multiple segments,
  - & then run parallel scans on multiple segments.
  - This will increase the load on database.
  - If there are other R/W operations going on, best to not use this.
