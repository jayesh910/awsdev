ProvisionedThroughputExceededException:
If request is too high for the R/W capacity provisioned on your DynamoDB table
SDK will automatically retries the requests until failure
If not using SDK:
  - Reduce request frequency
  - Use Exponential backoff

Many components in a network can  generate errors due to being overload

In addition to simple retries, SDK uses exponential backoff
Progressively longer waits between consecutive retries: 50ms, 100 ms, 200ms
If after 1 minute this doesn't work, your request size may be exceeding the throughput for your R/W capacity

Exponential backoff is also used forevery AWS SDK & applies to many services.e.g. S3, cloudformation, SES.
