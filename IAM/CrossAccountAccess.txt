CROSS-ACCOUNT ACCESS:
Delegate access to resources in different AWS account that you own.
Different account for Dev & production
Manage resources in other account from one account
Create a role in one account to allow access & grant permissions to users in different account
Also can switch roles No password is required

Demo for Prod & Dev Environment:
Create a IAM policy in prod for s3 access & attach it to IAM role
Create a IAM policy in Dev.
In prod, mention the Dev account id to give access in that IAM role
Now you can switch role between the Prod user & Created new user with Dev access
