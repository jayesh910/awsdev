3 tyoes of LB:
1. Application LB
2. Network LB
3. Classic LB

Application LB : Works upto application layer
Routing is based on the application
Are best suited for load balancing of HTTPS and HTTP traffic.
Operate at layer7 and are application aware
Intelligent, & you can create advanced request routing, sending specific requests to web servers

Network LB : It works on network layer .
Best for load balancing of TCP traffic where extreme performance is required.
Capable of handling millions of requests / seconds, maintaining ultra low latencies.
But Expensive 

Classic LB : It works only for legacy purpose.
Load balance http/https application & use layer7 specific features such as X-forwarded and Sticky session.
Also use strict layer 4 load balance for applications that rely on TCP protocol.
