3 tyoes of LB:
1. Application LB
2. Network LB
3. Classic LB

Application LB : Works upto application layer
Routing is based on the application
Are best suited for load balancing of HTTPS and HTTP traffic.
Operate at layer7 and are application aware
Intelligent, & you can create advanced request routing, sending specific requests to web servers

Network LB : It works on network layer .
Best for load balancing of TCP traffic where extreme performance is required.
Capable of handling millions of requests / seconds, maintaining ultra low latencies.
But Expensive 

Classic LB : It works only for legacy purpose.
Load balance http/https application & use layer7 specific features such as X-forwarded and Sticky session.
Also use strict layer 4 load balance for applications that rely on TCP protocol.
If appln stops responding return 504 error.
This means that appn having issues. This could be at web server layer or database layer.
Identify where appln is failing and scale-up or down where possible.
Error504: gateway timeout error.

X-Forwared Header: helps you identify the IP address of a client when you use an HTTP or HTTPS load balancer. Because load balancers intercept traffic between clients and servers, your server access logs contain only the IP address of the load balancer.
