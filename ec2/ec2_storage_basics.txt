EBS Basics: 
===========
EBS are persistent.
i.e. they can live even after instance is terminated.
Attach to one instance at a time.
Can be backedup to snapshot
which can be later restored to new EBS
EBS replicated within AZ's
Mount Path : /dev/xvda or /dev/sda1
Highly available: 


EBS Performance:
================
Performance measured in IOPS
AWS measures in 256KB chunks
OPS that are > 256 KB are separated into individual chunks
FOR e.g. a 512KB will be counted as 2 IOPS

EBS Volume types:
1. General Purpose SSD
2. Provisioned IOPS SSD
3. Throughput Optimized HDD and Cold HDD
4. EBS Magnetic 

1. General Purpose SSD: Use for Dev/Test env.& smaller DB instances.
  Performance - 3IOPS/GB of storage size
  Volume Size : 1 GB to 16TB
  Burstable with baseline performance
  Maximum: 16000 IOPS
  
2. Provisioned IOPS SSD:
  Large for mission critical applications
  Works for sustained IOPS performance
  Large DB workloads
  Volume Size: 4GB to 16TB
  Can reach 64000 IOPS per volume
  io2 is same price as io1
  io2 has 99.99% durability instead of 99.9% as of io1
  
3. Throughput optimized HDD and Cold HDD:
  Cheaper than SSD - less performance
  Cold HDD : Designed for less frequent access.
  Volume Size: 500 GB to 16TB
  Cannot be a boot volume
  Troughput of 40MB/s/TBS
  Can be use in Bigdata, Data Warehouse, ETL, Log processing.
 
4. Cold HDD:
  Througput 12MB/s/TB
  Good choice for colder data requires fewer scans per day. 
  
4. EBS Magnetic:
    Low Storage Cost
    Used where performance not required
    Volume Size: 1 GB to 1 TB
    
==========================================================
INSTANCE STORE VOLUME:

Underlying h/w is physically attached to HOST computer that is running the instance.
Considered as Ephemeral data(data will only present till the instance is alive)
Instance ->stop or shutdown , data is erased.
Instance ->rebooted , data persists.
Supports only in few instance types.



IOPS VS THROUGHPUT

IOPS: Measures the number of read & write operations per second.
      The ability to action reads and write very quickly.
Throuput: Measures the number of bits read or written per second.
