AWS Lambda

If you use AWS Lambda, you dont have to worry about above factors to manage.
========================================

Lambda is a compute service where you upload your code and create a lambda function.

-takes care of provisioning & managing the servers to run the code
-no worry about OS,patching & scaling
-Use lambda in foll ways:
  - event drive compute service
  - lambda runs your code in response to events
  - event examples: Change in S3 data or dynamoDb table
  Called as trigger
- To run your code  in response to HTTP requests using API gateway
- or API calls made using AWS SDKs

Working: 

Computer-> HTTPS requests -> API gateway -> Lambda function triggered
        <-                <-             <-                 
        
Languages supporting Lambda functions: Nodejs, Java, Python, C#, Go

Pricing: 
- First 1 million requests are free , $0.20 per 1 million requests thereafter
- Duration: Charges depends on how long lambda func. is triggered and response is delivered.

Lambda scales out(not up) automatically
They are independent: 1 lambda function = 1 event
