Import APIs

Use API gateway import API feature to import an API from external definition file into API gateway.
Currently, import API feature supports Swagger 2.0 definition files.

With the import API , you can either create a new API by submitting a post request
Update an existing API by using a PUT request.
Both above should contain swagger definition in the payload & endpoint configuration

Update an existing API by overwriting it with a new deifintion file or merge definition with existing API.

API Throttling:

By default, API gateway limits the steady-state request rate to 10000 requests per second.

If a caller submits 10000 requests in one second , API gateway processes all requests.
if caller sends 100000 requests in the first ms, API Gateway serves first 5000 requests and process other in other one-second period.

If you go over 10000 request per ms, it will return "429 too many request error".

SOAP Webservice passthrough: You can configure API gateway as SOAP web service passthrough.
