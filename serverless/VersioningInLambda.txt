You can publish 1 or more lambda functions
Work with different variations of your lambda function viz: development, beta & production
Each lambda func. version has a unique ARN. 
After you publish a version, it is immutable
Latest version is maintained as $LATEST.

Qualified/Unqualified ARNs: The ARN with the version suffix is qualified and other is not.

Alias: Mapping version as name in the tag of ARN version
You can split up the traffic of lambda function by mentioning the additional version and giving them weightage .
