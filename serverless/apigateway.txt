API: Application programming interface
Types: 
  1. REST APIs(Representational State Transfer)
    - Uses JSON
  2. SOAP APIs(Simple object Access protocol)
    - Uses XML
    
 API Gateways are fully managed service that makes it easy for developers to publish, maintain, monitor and secure APIs at any scale.
 From console, its easy to create API that will act as front door to connect to business logic, backend services & other AWS services.
 
 WHAT can API GATEWAY DO?:
  - Expose HTTPS endpoints to define REST APIs
  - Serverless-ly connecting to Lambda & DynamoDB
  - Send each API endpoint to different targets
  - Run efficiently with low cost
  - Scale effortlessly
  - Track & control usage of API key
  - Throttle request to prevent API attacks
  - Cloudwatch to log all requests
  - Maintain multiple version of APIs
  
To configure API Gateway:
  - DEfine an API
  - Resources & nested resources
  - set security
  - choose targets(EC2,lambda, DynDB,etc)
  - Deploy APIs to stages
  - Now supports AWS SSL certificates
  
API Gateways Caching helps by caching recent API calls and making api ready for next calls fast .
These reduces number of calls and works faster.
There is a TTL which will delete the api cache as it ends.

SAME ORIGIN POLICY:
In computing , the same-origin-policy is an important concept in the web application security model.
If you want to access API from one page of other page, you need to enable this policy
For this to work , origin needs to be same.
Done for preventing Cross-site-scripting attacks(XSS)

CORS:
Mechanism that allows restricted resources on a web page to be requested from another domain outside the domain from which the first resource was served

E.g. Browser makes HTTP OPTION call for URL.
ERROR: Origin policy cannot be read at the remote resource.
This means you need to enable CORS on API gateway.
CORS is enforced by the client.
