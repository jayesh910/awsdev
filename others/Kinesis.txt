Kinesis:
A family of services enables you to collect, process, & analyze streaming data, in real-time
Allows you to build custom applications for your own business needs.
Kinesis is a greek word meaning movement or motion
kinesis deals with data that is in motion or streaming data

Streaming data: Data generated continuously by thousands of data sources, 
which typically sends in the data records simultaneously & in KBs
e.g. Financial transactions,
     Stock prices,
     Game data,
     Social media feeds,
     Location tracking data(OLA,Uber)
     IoT sensors.
     Log files
     
Kinesis has family of services:
1. Kinesis Stream : Stream data & video that allow you to build custom application that process data in real time
Data streams & Video streams
2. Kinesis Data firehose: Capture, transform, load data streams into AWS data stores to enable near-real-time analytics
3. Kinesis Data analytics: Analyze, query & transform streamed data in real-time using standard SQL. Store in AWS Data store.

Kinesis Streams: 

All the devices will produce data -> Kinesis streams retains data for default 24hrs with max. 7 days retention
Data is stored in Shard.
Shards are sequence of data records.
Each shards has unique sequence number.
Consumers will consume data from kinesis streams.
Then data can be save to Permanent storage

Kinesis Shards:

Streams are made of shards
Each shard is a sequence of one or more data records & provides a fixed unit of capacity.
5 reads per second.
Max read rate = 2MB per second.
1000 write per second.
Max total write rate is 1MB per second

The data capacity of stream is determined by the no. of shards.
If the data rate increases, you can increase capacity on your stream by increasing number of shards.

Kinesis video streams:
=======================
Securely stream video from connected devices to AWS.
Videos can be used for analytics & machine learning.
============================================================
============================================================

KINESIS DATA FIREHOSE:
All devices are sending data to kinesis firehose. 
All the size & data management is managed automatically.
No need of consumers to consume data, optionally can use lambda function,
to go the data through Firehose before going to S3.
No data retention
To AWS Storage

Used when you have your own BI tool to analyze the data using Redshift, S3 or elasticsearch.

============================================================
============================================================
KINESIS DATA ANALYTICS:
Converts the data from producers to go through kinesis streams or kinesis firehose & ,
then convert it to SQL for real-time analytics to store in S3, RedShift or Elasticsearch.
