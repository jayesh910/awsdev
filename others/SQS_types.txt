2 types of SQS:

1. Standard Queues: They are the default which provide best-effort ordering
2. FIFO Queue: Order is strictly preserved

Standard Queues: Unlimited transactions, Guarantee, Best-effort ordering
FIFO Queues: First-in-first-out delivery, Exactly once processing, 300 Transaction per second (TPS) limit

FIFO is best used in financial, banking transactions.

Change the visibility timeout:
 default: 30 seconds
 increase if necessary : tasks takes more than 30 seconds
 maximum is 12 hours
 
Short polling vs Long polling

short polling will poll for every short period & in return will return the response msgs as empty
This will increase the money
Use long polling, scheduled time for polling. Can save money. Only returns when there is msg present .
