CICD SUMMARY:

CI : CodeCommit
Continuous Delivery: CodeBuild & CodeDeploy
Continuous Deployment: CodePipeline
AWS WhitePaper on Practicing continuous integration & continuous deployment on AWS

Codecommit: 
Centralised code repo
Enables collab & hndles version control

CodeDeploy:
In-Place deployment:
  Capacity is reduced 
  Lambda is not supported
  Rolling back involves a re-deploy
  Great when deploying first time
  
Blue/Green deployment:
  No Capacity reduction
  Green instances can be created
  Easy to switch between old & new
  Pay 4 2 environments until you terminate the old servers.
  
  Appspec.yml defines the parameters to be used by codedeploy
  Hooks: Scripts to run during deployment
    BeforeInstall,...
    
  Run Order
  In-place deployment: 3 phases - De-registering, installation, re-registering with load balanccer
  BeforeBlockTraffic -> BlockTraffic -> AfterBlockTraffic
  
  ApplicationStop-> DownloadBundle -> BeforeInstall -> Install -> AfterInstall -> ApplicationStart -> ValidateService

CodePipeline

CodeBuild:

  buildspec.yml: Defines the build commands & settings used by codebuild to run build
  Override settings
  Codebuild console to identify failures
  
Cloudformation: Infrastructure as a code
  SAM : Define & provision serverless app 
  SAM Package & SAM Deploy 
  To resue nested stack use parameter stacks.
