Codedeploy approaches:
1. In-place: The application is stopped on each instance & the new release is installed.
2. Blue/Green: New instances are provisioned & new release is installed on new instances.
Blue -> active deployment, Green -> new release

In-place: 
Codedeploy installs the new version, known as revision.
