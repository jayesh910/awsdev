ENVOLOPE_ENCRYPTION:

Process for encrypting your data. Applies to files>4KB

AWS KMS (CMK) -> GenerateDataKeyAPI -> Data Key(Envelope key) -encrypts-> YOUR DATA 

Encrypted data key is stored on the local 

For decryption:
  - data key is present on local encrypted. Using kms cmk , using decrypt api,
  data key will be decrypted into plaintext then using this decrypted data key, 
  we can decrypt the data.
  
In case of KMS CMK, whole data is encrypted with the key and passed on to network.
Whereas in case of KMS CMK data key, only the data key is encrypted & passed on to network,
& data is kept locally encrypted. This reduces network traffic & can be used for large data.
